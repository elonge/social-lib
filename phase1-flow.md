Unidentified Spines

The system automatically:

Flags duplicates against the existing library

Excludes already-owned books from the staged list (or marks them as duplicates)

User reviews the staged list and commits approved books.

The library updates with the new additions.

C. Visitor from a shared link

User opens a shared library link.

They see a read-only view of the library.

Clear CTA: “Create your own library” / “Scan your bookshelf”

Clicking the CTA starts the new user upload → staged list flow.

Signup is required only when saving.

Subtle but important UX implications (intentional)

Recognition is framed as probabilistic, not binary
This builds trust and reduces disappointment.

Users feel in control
They are approving additions, not fixing mistakes.

The system never “fails silently”
Unidentified spines are acknowledged explicitly.

The Staged List becomes a first-class concept
It’s the same flow for:

New users

Existing users

Incremental uploads

This consistency will pay off later as features expand.
